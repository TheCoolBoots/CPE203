Static Method: methods that can be used without instantiating an object

CRC card
	describes a class, its responsibilities, and its collaborating classes
	use index card
	verbs to describe methods

relationships between classes
	dependency
		class being used by another class
		arrow from class using the class to the dependent class
		dashed arrow from class using the class to dependent class

types of Dependencies
	aggregation
		a class is made up of one or more instances of another class
		eg. a car is made up of an engine, 4 wheels, etc.
		solid line with diamond on aggregate object
	association
		a class references another class
	composition
		one of the classes cannot exist without the other
		would not run without instances of other class
	inheritance
		define a class as a subclass of another class
		solid arrow from child to parent

Multiplicities: Multiple aggregates in single class -- 
	* = Any Number
	1..* = One or More
	0..1 = Zero or One
	1 = exactly one

encapsulation: objects of classes do not have direct access to the variables of another class
	AKA information hiding
	hiding implementation data
	allows use of a class without knowing its implementation

class = blueprint
instance = instantiation of class
object = general term for either

instance variable = variables within a class

Javadocs--
	comments should all be /**
	@param [name, short explanation]
	@return [describe return value]
	
	ex:
	/** Withdraws from bank account
	    @param amount to withdraw
	*/
	

instance methods = methods that require an instantiation of a class to use

Interfaces:
    define interface in class definition
    define all methods that should be in implementation
    
Generic programming
    ArrayList<String>
    in constructor use whatever is in <> inside class
    act as placeholders
    usually use one letter names for Generic Variables
    
    class definition:
    public class Pair<T,S>{
        public Pair(T firstElement, S secondElement){
        
        }
    }
    
reading and writing to text files

    File(String filepath)
    Scanner.next/nextInt/nextDouble
    Scanner.hasNext
    Scanner.useDelimiter **look this up x`
    
    PrintWriter(String filepath)
    out.println/printf
    use "UTF-8" as second parameter for Scanner and PrintWriter

Functional Programming
  terminal operation = operator to end functional pipeline
    Java Stream
        changes array/arraylist to be able to use functional programming
        
        //prints out all values in the list
        IntStream.of([array]).forEach(value -> System.out.printf("%d ", value);

        //prints out sum of all numbers
        System.out.println(IntStream.of([array]).reduce(0, (x, y) -> x+y))

        Intstream.of([array]).filter(s -> s.compareToIgnoreCase("n") < 0) //look this up
        intStream.of([array]).sorted(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary()))
        IntStream.of([array]).map
        distinct
        limit
        forEach(lamda expression)
        average
        count
        max
        min
        reduce(init val, (x,y)->x+y) where x is the initial value
        collect
        toArray
        findFirst
        findAny
        anyMatch
        allMatch
        
    functional interfaces:
        Function<T, R > calls a function on type T returns type R
            Function<int, int> myFunction = (int x, int y)->{return x+y;}
                                                ^anonymous function
            myFunction.apply
        Predicate<T> returns true or false
        BinaryOperator<T> calls a function on type T returns type T
        Consumer<T> does something to an object in a collection
        Supplier<T> create a collection in which a stream's operations are placed
        
    predicate interface
        results in a stream of objects that match the Predicate
        Predicate<Employee> fourToSixThousand = e-> (e.getSalary() >= 4000 && e.getSalary() <= 6000);
        [stream].filter(fourToSixThousand);
        
        
    Lambda expressions:
        (x,y) -> x+y
        
    using methods of other classes in lamda expression
        .map(String::toUpperCase)
        
    Abstract class
        a class that cannot be instantiated
