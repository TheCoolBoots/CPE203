The way in which I organized the methods in this project are as follows:
1. resulting Dependencies must be unidirectional (ex. only parent to child no child to parent)
2. Methods must be in the lowest class possible to achieve unidirectional Dependencies
3. VirtualWorld is the top-most class, aggregating instances of the largest classes, and no other class should depend on it
